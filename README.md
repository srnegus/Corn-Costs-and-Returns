# Introduction
This project focuses on using SQL to analyze the historical costs and returns of corn over a period of time. As a beginner-level project, the goal is to practice basic SQL skills such as querying, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data to explore trends in the economics of corn production.

The project involves working with a dataset that contains information on various factors affecting corn production, such as planting costs, labor, fertilizer expenses, market prices, and overall returns. Using SQL, we will analyze how these costs and returns have changed over the years and identify patterns that can provide insights into the economic factors influencing corn farming.
